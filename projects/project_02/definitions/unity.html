    <h1>UNITY</h1>
    <p>1. A condition of concordant harmony; the state of full agreement; accord</p>
    <p class="blurb">"Stronger Together" was the theme of Mexican American designer Raul Solís’s spring/summer 2021 collection. The message was a call for unity and community in the midst of unprecedented division in American politics, turbulent social-justice demonstrations, and the devastation of the global COVID-19 pandemic. Titled "American Stripe," this dress from the collection is printed with the phrase in solid block letters along the left edge of the bodice. Its red-and-white fabric is draped around the figure like an uncut and unfinished flag.</p>
