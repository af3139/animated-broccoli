        <p class="blurb">Tristan Detwiler began reworking antique quilts into garments in 2018. A chance encounter with eighty-year-old quilt maker Claire McKarns introduced Detwiler to the Bumann Quilters of Olivenhain, California. After becoming a member, he applied the group’s shared knowledge to his autumn/winter 2021–22 collection. He constructed this ensemble using a late nineteenth-century one-patch pattern quilt given to him by McKarns. By cutting the jacket and trouser patterns directly from the quilt, he was able to maintain its original design.</p>
