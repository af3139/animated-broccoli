    <h1>ARTFULNESS</h1>
    <p>1. The quality or state of being artful or showing a noteworthy use of imagination and creativity</p>
    <p class="blurb">A piece of embroidery executed in his native Haiti and shared with him by his sister Brigitte inspired the first of Fabrice Simonâ€™s beaded designs. Beaded garments based on embroidery patterns he drafted himself would become his signature. As in this dress, they often retain the lively and spontaneous quality of a drawing. Previous experience as a textile designer likely honed his ability to create patterns that harmonize with the body in the finished garment.
