    <h1>EXUBERANCE</h1>
    <p>1. The quality or state of being exuberant (joyously unrestrained and enthusiastic)</p>
    <p class="blurb">Christopher John Rogers has described his design philosophy as creating fashions that are both emotional and transformational, which become tools for self-expression through vibrant color and dramatic volume. This dress from his autumn/winter 2020â€“21 collection exemplifies the expressive nature of his designs, conveying a sense of unrestrained enthusiasm with a vividly colored plaid silk and an expansive, nine-foot-wide skirt. The design amplifies the patterning, intense colors, and extravagant silhouettes of mid-nineteenth-century gowns for a more emphatic statement.</p>
