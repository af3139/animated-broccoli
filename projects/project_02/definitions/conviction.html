    <h1>CONVICTION</h1>
    <p>1. A state of mind in which one is free from doubt</p>
    <p class="blurb">In Donna Karan’s first collection for her own label, she introduced a concept that became known as "Seven Easy Pieces." This series of coordinated separates—bodysuits, trousers, skirts, and jackets—could be variously combined for different occasions and formed the foundation of a modular wardrobe. These fashions offered the wearer an alternative language of professional dress that was both commanding and feminine, while providing a sense of assurance due to their comfort, ease of coordination, and compatibility with work and personal life. </p>
