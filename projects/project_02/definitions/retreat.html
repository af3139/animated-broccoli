    <h1>RETREAT</h1>
    <p>1. An act or process of withdrawing especially from what is difficult, dangerous or disagreeable</p>
    <p class="blurb">The blurring between the home and the office, relaxation, and responsibility that resulted from the COVID-19 pandemic provided the stimulus for Jack McCollough and Lazaro Hernandez’s autumn/winter 2021–22 collection, which emphasized elements of ease and versatility. This knitted dress features a gathering that twists around the body, as if its wearer is draped in a blanket while en route to the office. Its high neckline and extra-long hem provide maximum coverage, offering physical and psychological sanctuary.</p>
