    <h1>DEVOTION</h1>
    <p>1. Ardent love or affection</p>
    <p class="blurb">Isabel Toledo described her work as "dressing emotions," acknowledging the power fashion has to both express the wearer’s emotions and change how they feel. She matched this consideration with masterful technical knowledge—an intimate understanding of the way fabric could be draped, folded, or stitched to achieve a desired effect. Toledo’s devotion to her craft, through constant hands-on experimentation, yielded garments with unique structures, like this dress composed of tubes of rayon jersey that gently embrace the body, enclosing it in soft folds.</p>
