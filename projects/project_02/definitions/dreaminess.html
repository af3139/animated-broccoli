    <h1>DREAMINESS</h1>
    <p>1. The quality or state of being dreamy (given to dreaming or fantasy)</p>
    <p class="blurb">Since founding his eponymous label in 2015, Matthew Adams Dolan has sought to subvert traditional signifiers of American sportswear. For his autumn/winter 2017–18 collection, he recast utilitarian fabrics and silhouettes into ensembles evocative of at-home comfort. This shirt and trousers are cut in Dolan’s signature exaggerated proportions, suggesting ill-fitting pajamas. A quilt strapped to the shoulder summons the coziness of bedtime. Drawing inspiration from John Lennon and Yoko Ono’s 1969 Vietnam protest movement, "Bed-ins for Peace," Dolan cited a need for solace and hope during times of chaos.</p>
