    <h1>SWEETNESS</h1>
    <p>1. The quality or state of being sweet (arousing agreeable or delightful emotions)</p>
    <p class="blurb">Isaac Mizrahi employs signature design elements such as vivid colors and unexpected juxtapositions to create his playful interpretations of American sportswear. Inspired by the films Nanook of the North and Call of the Wild, Mizrahiâ€™s autumn/winter 1994 collection combined cold-weather wear with traditional midcentury silhouettes. The baby-doll dress displayed here is rendered strapless, as if it were a shrunken 1950s ball gown. The varying shades of pink (dubbed "poodle, pepto, powder and pez" by WWD) lend charm to the weatherized design.</p>
