    <h1>DISCIPLINE</h1>
    <p>1. An orderly or regular pattern of behavior</p>
    <p class="blurb">Thom Browne’s designs are rooted in the inventive adaptation of classic forms. He has proposed interpretations of the mid-twentieth-century man’s suit, composed of traditional materials in varied shades of gray, as a universal modern uniform. In Browne’s conception, however, the uniform’s regularity is not delimiting. Instead, its varied permutations allow a sense of individuality to be conveyed through subtle but distinctive details—shifted proportions, the intermingling of conventionally masculine and feminine codes of dress, and the precision of cut, construction, and fabric selection that defines his work.</p>
