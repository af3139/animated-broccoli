    <h1>INTIMACY</h1>
    <p>1. The state of being intimate, such as a close association or connection or a relationship marked by depth of knowledge or broadness of information</p>
    <p class="blurb">Jean Yuâ€™s approach relies on exacting construction and a deep understanding of the distinct properties of her materials. Exemplifying the timeless quality of her designs, this dress eschews embellishment in favor of "soft architecture," as the designer has referred to her ethereal creations. Delicate silk georgette is suspended from grosgrain ribbon, forming an intimate connection between body and cloth in which the body is revealed or concealed through precise draping that creates varying degrees of transparency.</p>
