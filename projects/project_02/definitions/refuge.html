    <h1>REFUGE</h1>
    <p>1. A means of resort for help in difficulty</p>
    <p class="blurb">Yeohlee Teng coined the term "urban nomad" for her autumn/winter 1997–98 collection to describe "a person fully engaged and living a twenty-first-century lifestyle which is urban and global." This coat, which features the designer’s signature simple geometric cuts, reflects her interest in architecture, inspired as it was by Renzo Piano’s curvilinear Kansai International Airport. Rendered in a striped Alpaca, it also references the blanket-like coverings of the nomads of Mongolia. Its materiality offers versatility and movement, while its construction encapsulates Teng’s vision of clothing as shelter.</p>
