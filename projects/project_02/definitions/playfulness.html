    <h1>PLAYFULNESS</h1>
    <p>1. The quality of being lighthearted or full of fun</p>
    <p class="blurb">Jeremy Scott has said that for him "fashion is an emotion," describing his designs as led by his feelings and intended to evoke a sense of happiness. In this playful homage to Patrick Kelly’s joyful fashions, Scott has exaggerated the designer’s signature button motif, encrusting the wearer in a field of color. The bold but lighthearted embellishment seems to join both wearer and observer in a shared emotion elicited by the exuberant spirit of the design.</p>
