    <h1>COMMEMORATION</h1>
    <p>1. The act of calling to rememberance</p>
    <p class="blurb">Sarah Nsikak’s fashions celebrate the resilience and creativity of African makers. This ensemble features her signature one-of-a-kind patchwork dresses inspired by the traditional costumes of Namibia’s Herero tribe that are pieced from the remnants of used garments and modeled after the nineteenth-century silhouettes of German colonists. Made of locally sourced surplus cotton, Nsikak’s dress combines panels of printed fabric in a carefully organized arrangement of pattern and color on the skirt, which falls in voluminous folds from a band at the bust line supported by flat straps at the shoulder.</p>
