    <h1>SENTIMENTALITY</h1>
    <p>1. The quality or state of being marked or governed by feeling, sensibility, or emotional idealism</p>
    <p class="blurb">Emily Adams Bode launched her namesake menswear label in spring/summer 2018 with a collection of garments made entirely of antique textiles. She continues to create one-of-a-kind garments using internationally sourced vintage fabrics that evoke the periods and places in which they were produced. This ensemble is constructed from two quilts in chaotic patterns, identifiable by the haphazard arrangement of fabrics in varied shapes and weaves. The history of each fragment reflects the element of storytelling embedded in Bodeâ€™s fashions.</p>
