    <h1>AUTHENTICITY</h1>
    <p>1. The quality or state of being authentic (not false or copied; genuine, real)</p>
    <p class="blurb">The designer Miguel Adrover presented his collections regularly in New York from 1999 to 2005. An early proponent of diverse and inclusive casting, he became renowned for his political engagement, creative use of repurposed fabrics, and local production. This coat from his autumn/winter 2000– 2001 "Meet Town" collection is a customized Burberry trench coat turned inside out and dressed backwards. Adrover’s unapproved use of a Burberry garment provoked a lawsuit for copyright infringement from the British house.</p>
