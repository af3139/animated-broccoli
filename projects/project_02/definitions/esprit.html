    <h1>ESPRIT</h1>
    <p>1. Cleverness and vivacity as of spirit and mind; sprightly wit; an inherent lively and colorful quality</p>
    <p class="blurb">Carolina Herreraâ€™s designs are closely connected to her personal style, which is defined by an image of effortless elegance and by her clever interpretations of classic garments, such as the plain white button-down shirt. For Herrera, the appeal of this essential item is its ability to transform from casual to formal. In this evening ensemble, a crisp white shirt is given vibrancy through its pairing with a burgundy taffeta skirt, while the shirt itself lends a sense of nonchalant ease.</p>
