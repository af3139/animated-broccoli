    <h1>Reverie</h1>
    <p>1. The condition of being lost in thought</p>
    <p class="blurb">No Sesso, the label founded by Pierre Davis in 2015 and codesigned with Autumn Randolph, translates from Italian as "no sex/gender." Although a commitment to gender-neutral design is fundamental to their practice, they are equally dedicated to sustainable production and diverse representation. For their autumn/winter 2017â€“ 18 collection, Davis and Randolph imagined a wardrobe for Black bodies in an optimistic future. This wrap coat features a kaleidoscopic arrangement of repurposed denim finished with a buoyant flounce at the top edge and bottom hem.</p>
